# Hello Self!

#### This is an excercise in using markdown to create a cheet sheet for bash commands.

You're going to need to accomplish a few things to complete this task:

1. Create an ordered list with children AND lists that contain multiple lines of the same list item.
  This is supposed to be part of the same list on a new line.
    1. this is supposed to represent a child of number one.

2. create an unordered list with children AND lists that contain multiple lines of the same list item
    3. use block quotes
    4. use **bold** and _italics_
5. use at least 2 different heading sizes
6. create a [link](www.google.com) to another website using an inline link
7. create a [link][I'm a reference] to another website using a reference link
8. create an ![image](www.randomkittengenerator.com) using an inline link
9. create an ![image][I'm another reference] using a reference link
10. use soft breaks somewhere
* publish the readme file to github
    * create a code block ``<html>Did it work?</html>``
  this is supposed to be part of the unordered list item "create a code block" above
    * create an email url link <ronaldjamescross@gmail.com>
* create a table
    * and of course, write your list of bash commands as a cheet sheet

>Here's some text that I'd like to have in block quotes. Let's see if it works
